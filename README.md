### Hi there 👋 I’m **Pulkit**, a Software Engineer & Tech Creator

Curious mind in a digital world — building things, solving problems, and occasionally writing about them. I work full-time in IT and explore ideas around automation, AI agents, and modern development in my free time.

- 🔭 Currently juggling code by day and crafting digital content by night  
- 🌱 Exploring advanced ML frameworks and cloud-native design  
- 👀 Always tinkering with ideas for tools, workflows, or new experiments  
- 💬 Ask me about **AI agents, React, Java**, or anything that blends code and creativity  
- 📫 Connect with me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pulkit-rana1) | [Medium](https://pulkit-rana.medium.com)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think gaming and curiosity make the best combination for learning
